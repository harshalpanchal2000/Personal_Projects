Hi, In this project I designed various charts & dashboards to brief report the market share of passenger cars
(by make, e.g. Maruti, Hyundai, Toyota, Ford, Tesla, etc.) across: Global & India. 
I also created vizz of the market share in terms of:
1. Number of cars sold
2. Revenue earned

Hope you find it insightful!!
