# Unveiling Data Sharing Discrepancies: Consent and Control in Social Media Platforms

My recent research endeavor involved an in-depth exploration of the Consent and Control dynamics surrounding data sharing practices on various social media platforms. Through a rigorous analysis of more than 20 research papers, I sought to uncover the gaps and challenges in ensuring users' informed consent and granular control over their personal information.

# üîç Key Highlights:

Scrutinized a diverse range of research literature, spanning user behavior, platform policies, legal frameworks, and technological mechanisms.
Detected patterns of consent manipulation and instances of limited user agency within data sharing ecosystems.
Investigated the implications of emerging technologies such as AI-driven profiling and algorithmic decision-making on user privacy.
Formulated a comprehensive framework to evaluate consent mechanisms and control options available to users on different platforms.
Proposed recommendations for platform designers, policymakers, and users to enhance transparency and accountability in data sharing practices.
This project allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical implications, fostering a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by consent and control issues. I am enthusiastic about driving conversations on ethical data practices in the digital age.
